Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight

He says, "Son, can you play me a memory
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes."

It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sitting next to me
Makin' love to his tonic and gin

La la la, di da da
La la, di da da da dum

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight.
